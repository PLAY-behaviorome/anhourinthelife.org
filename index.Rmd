# An hour in the life...

### A study that looks at how moms and children behave in their natural home environments.

<img src="img/PLAY-momchild.png" width=1000><br>

<div class="img1000">    
<br><br>
University researchers from across North America are coming together to learn about what moms and children do at home. They are looking for interested families with young children (up to 2 years of age). Experienced researchers will visit the homes of participating families and record a slice of the daily lives of mothers and children. This study may help scientists to better understand how children learn in the home.
