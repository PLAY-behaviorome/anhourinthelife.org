We are university researchers launching the first large-scale study on what babies do at home! We are inviting one thousand families across North America with babies (up to 2 years of age) to participate in this exciting study. Experienced researchers will visit your home and record a slice of your daily life. You will be helping scientists to better understand how children learn in the home.
