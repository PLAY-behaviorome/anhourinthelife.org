### behave in their natural home environments.

<img src="img/PLAY-momchild.png" width=640><br>


<div class="img640">    
Researchers across 30 universities in North America are coming together to learn about what mothers and children do at home. Experienced researchers will visit the homes of participating families and record a slice of the daily lives of mothers and children. Participating families may help scientists to better understand how children learn in the home.

<div class="img640">    
This single-session study will last between 120 and 180 minutes. If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you and your child to go about your daily activities for an hour in your home while we film you. We will also film the rooms in your home, measure the spaces that are accessible to your child, and record the decibel level of ambient noise in your home. We may ask you and your child to play with a set of child-friendly toys for a few minutes. Finally, we may ask you questions about your child’s locomotion, language, emotion, health, toys and animals and media use in the home, and racial and ethnic background as well questions about family health, division of household labor, and education. 

_**You will receive a \$50 gift card for your participation.**_

Your and your child’s participation are voluntary and you can choose to end a session at any time without loss of benefits. You have the right to review videos and other records of your home visit session and request that all or any portion of the data be destroyed. You have the right to skip any questions you do not wish to answer. There are no known risks associated with your child’s participation in this research beyond those of everyday life.
