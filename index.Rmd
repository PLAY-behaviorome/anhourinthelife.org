We are researchers launching the first large-scale study on what babies do at home! We are inviting one thousand families across the United States with babies (up to 2 yrs of age) to participate in this exciting study. Experienced researchers will visit your home and record a slice of your daily life. You will be helping scientists to better understand how children learn and develop.

### COVID-19 Considerations
Researchers abide by the following protections:

* Are _fully vaccinated_
* Wear a _mask_ at all times
* Will not physically interact with you or your child
* Clean any equipment that is placed on a home surface

After each home visit, researchers sanitize anything brought into a home.
