# An hour in the life...

### A study that looks at how mothers and children behave in their natural home environments.

<img src="img/PLAY-momchild.png" width=1000><br>


<div class="img1000">    
Researchers in universities across North America are coming together to learn about what mothers and children do at home. Experienced researchers will visit the homes of participating families and record a slice of the daily lives of mothers and children. Participating families may help scientists to better understand how children learn in the home.

This single-session study will last between 120 and 180 minutes. If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you and your child to go about your daily activities for an hour in your home while we film you. We will also film the rooms in your home, measure the spaces that are accessible to your child, and record the decibel level of ambient noise in your home. We will ask you and your child to play with a set of child-friendly toys for a few minutes. Finally, we will ask you some questions about your child's skills and routines and about your home and family.
